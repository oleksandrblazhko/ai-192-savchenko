| № Загрози | Назва зв'язку | STRIDE-клас загрози | Назва загрози | Опис загрози |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | Browser-Web-App-Request | Denial of Service | An adversary can perform action on behalf of other user due to lack of controls against cross domain requests | Failure to restrict requests originating from third party domains may result in unauthorized actions or access of data |
| 2 | Browser-Web-App-Request | Elevation of Privileges | An adversary may bypass critical steps or perform actions on behalf of other users (victims) due to improper validation logic | Failure to restrict the privileges and access rights to the application to individuals who require the privileges or access rights may result into unauthorized use of data due to inappropriate rights settings and validation. |
| 3 | Browser-Web-App-Request | Information Disclosure | An adversary can reverse weakly encrypted or hashed content | An adversary can reverse weakly encrypted or hashed content |
| 4 | Browser-Web-App-Request | Information Disclosure | An adversary may gain access to sensitive data from log files | An adversary may gain access to sensitive data from log files |
| 5 | Browser-Web-App-Request | Repudiation | Attacker can deny the malicious act and remove the attack foot prints leading to repudiation issues | Proper logging of all security events and user actions builds traceability in a system and denies any possible repudiation issues. In the absence of proper auditing and logging controls, it would become impossible to implement any accountability in a system |
| 6 | Browser-Web-App-Request | Spoofing | An adversary can get access to a user's session due to improper logout and timeout | The session cookies is the identifier by which the server knows the identity of current user for each incoming request. If the attacker is able to steal the user token he would be able to access all user data and perform all actions on behalf of user. |
| 7 | Browser-Web-App-Request | Tampering | An adversary can deface the target web application by injecting malicious code or uploading dangerous files | Website defacement is an attack on a website where the attacker changes the visual appearance of the site or a webpage. |
| 8 | Browser-Web-App-Request | Spoofing | An adversary may spoof an Azure administrator and gain access to Azure subscription portal | An adversary may spoof an Azure administrator and gain access to Azure subscription portal if the administrator's credentials are compromised. |
| 9 | Web-App-DB-Request | Elevation of Privileges | An adversary can gain unauthorized access to Azure Postgres DB instances due to weak network security configuration | An adversary can gain unauthorized access to  Azure Database for PostgreSQL instances due to weak network security configuration. |
| 10 | Web-App-DB-Request | Tampering | An adversary may read and/or tamper with the data transmitted to Azure Postgres DB due to weak configuration | An adversary may read and/or tamper with the data transmitted to Azure Database for PostgreSQL due to weak configuration. |
| 11 | Web-App-DB-Request | Information Disclosure | An adversary can reverse weakly encrypted or hashed content | An adversary can reverse weakly encrypted or hashed content |
| 12 | Web-App-DB-Request | Repudiation | Attacker can deny the malicious act and remove the attack foot prints leading to repudiation issues | Proper logging of all security events and user actions builds traceability in a system and denies any possible repudiation issues. In the absence of proper auditing and logging controls, it would become impossible to implement any accountability in a system |
| 13 | Web-App-DB-Request | Spoofing | An adversary can spoof the target web application due to insecure TLS certificate configuration | Ensure that TLS certificate parameters are configured with correct values |
| 14 | Web-App-DB-Request | Spoofing | An adversary can steal sensitive data like user credentials | Attackers can exploit weaknesses in system to steal user credentials. Downstream and upstream components are often accessed by using credentials stored in configuration stores. Attackers may steal the upstream or downstream component credentials. Attackers may steal credentials if, Credentials are stored and sent in clear text, Weak input validation coupled with dynamic sql queries, Password retrieval mechanism are poor, |
